Sure, I'd be glad to transform the given instructions into a detailed, step-by-step tutorial. Let's break it down:

# Tutorial: Adding Functionality to Your Page & Setting Up Webhooks

## Step 1: Initial Appreciation and Planning

**Task:** Be ready to devote some time to this task and aim to finish it by close of Sunday.

**Instructions:**
1. Find a quiet and comfortable place where you can focus.
2. Allocate a block of time before Sunday's close to dedicate to this task.

## Step 2: Introduction to Adding Functionality

**Task:** Understand the basic process of adding functionality by clicking on components.

**Instructions:**
1. Familiarize yourself with the page on which you're working.
2. Notice that adding functionalities to the page involves a simple process of clicking on the appropriate components.

## Step 3: Adding an Upload Functionality

**Task:** Add an "Upload" functionality to the page.

**Instructions:**
1. Locate the control panel, which should be situated on the right side of your screen.
2. Within the control panel, look for a plus (+) sign. This symbol indicates where you can add new functionalities.
3. Click on the plus (+) sign.
4. A list of different functionalities will appear.
5. From this list, find and select the "Upload Media" functionality.

## Step 4: Choosing the Type of Media for Upload Functionality

**Task:** Specify the type of media that can be uploaded using this functionality.

**Instructions:**
1. After clicking on the "Upload Media" functionality, you will be prompted to specify the type of media that can be uploaded.
2. Manually type the desired media types into the provided text box. For instance, if you want to allow .mp4 and .mov file types, type ".mp4, .mov" (without the quotation marks).
3. Do not worry about the exact wording; the system provides placeholders to guide you.

## Step 5: Replicating the Process for Other Components

**Task:** Repeat the process of adding functionalities to other components on the page.

**Instructions:**
1. Select another component on the page.
2. Follow the same process as in Steps 3 and 4 to add desired functionalities to this component.
3. Repeat this process for all the components on your desktop page that you want to have certain functionalities.

## Step 6: Setting up Webhooks

**Task:** Set up webhooks to connect the functionalities to the backend.

**Instructions:**
1. After you're done adding functionalities to all the desired components, the next step is to connect these functionalities to your backend. This is done through a process called setting up webhooks.
2. To be continued (as the original instructions do not provide details on how to set up webhooks).

Please note that this tutorial lacks some information, especially the part about setting up webhooks. You may need to find additional resources or get further instructions to complete these parts.
