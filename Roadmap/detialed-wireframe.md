#### Task 0: Environment Setup
1. Download and install your preferred Python IDE (e.g., PyCharm, Visual Studio Code).
2. Install Python 3.8 or higher on your machine if you haven't already.
3. Set up a new virtual environment for your project to isolate your project dependencies.
4. Install Flask, Celery, and Redis in your virtual environment using pip.
5. Create a new Flask project in your IDE.

#### Task 1: User Authentication
1. Using SQLAlchemy (a Python SQL toolkit and ORM), define a User model with necessary fields (username, hashed_password, email, etc.).
2. Implement a registration endpoint that takes a username, email, and password as input, validates these fields, hashes the password, and creates a new User in the database.
3. Implement a login endpoint that takes a username and password as input, validates these fields, checks the password against the hashed password in the database, and returns a session token.

#### Task 2: Video Upload
1. Implement a video upload endpoint that receives a video file from the frontend.
2. Use Python's built-in file handling functions to save the video file to a specified directory.
3. Store a reference to the video file (file path) in the database.

#### Task 3: Video Transcription
1. Write a function that takes a video file path as input and sends a request to Descript's API to transcribe the video.
2. Process the API response and extract the transcription.
3. Store the transcription in the database, linked to the corresponding video.

#### Task 4: User Prompt
1. Using SQLAlchemy, define a Prompt model with necessary fields (user_id, video_id, prompt_text, etc.).
2. Implement an endpoint that takes a user_id, video_id, and prompt_text as input, validates these fields, and creates a new Prompt in the database.

#### Task 5: GPT-4 Caption Generation
1. Write a function that takes a transcription and a user prompt as input and sends a request to GPT-4 to generate captions.
2. Process the API response and extract the generated captions.
3. Store the generated captions in the database, linked to the corresponding video and prompt.

#### Task 6: LangChain Integration
1. Learn how to use LangChain by reading its documentation and examples.
2. Write a function that takes the generated captions as input and communicates with LangChain and the social media platform agents to get the platform-specific requirements.
3. Update the generated captions based on the requirements received from LangChain.

#### Task 7: Caption Finalization
1. Write a function that takes the updated captions and the platform-specific requirements as input and finalizes the captions to fit these requirements.
2. Store the finalized captions in the database, linked to the corresponding video, prompt, and platform.

#### Task 8: Video Posting
1. Learn how to use the APIs of the social media platforms by reading their documentation and examples.
2. Write a function that takes a video file, finalized captions, and platform as input and sends a request to the platform's API to post the video and captions.
3. Implement an endpoint that triggers this function when the user clicks "Post".

#### Task 9: Additional Features (Optional)
1. Research AI plugins for generating thumbnails and upscaling videos.
2. Implement these features as separate functions or endpoints as needed.

#### Task 10: Testing
1. Write unit tests for each function and endpoint using a testing library like pytest.
2. Write integration tests that test

#### Task 10: Testing
1. Write unit tests for each function and endpoint using a testing library like pytest.
2. Write integration tests that test the flow of the system as a whole. This will likely involve creating mock data, calling your endpoints in a specific order, and checking the output at each step.
3. Run your tests frequently during development to catch and fix issues early.

#### Task 11: Deployment
1. Choose a hosting platform for your backend (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Heroku).
2. Follow the hosting platform's instructions to deploy your Flask application. This will typically involve setting up a new instance or app, installing your dependencies, and deploying your code.
3. Test your deployed application to make sure everything works correctly. This will likely involve calling your endpoints and checking the responses, as well as monitoring the logs and performance metrics provided by the hosting platform.

For each of these tasks, we'll want to create a new branch in like Git. Each branch should be named after the task it's meant for (e.g., "user-authentication", "video-upload"). After completing a task and testing it thoroughly, merge the branch into your main branch. This approach will keep your codebase organized and make it easier to track the progress of each task.
