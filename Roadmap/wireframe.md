                              POSTME! WIREFRAME

1. User Authentication:
    - User signs in with Google SSO or Facebook.
    - Authentication success redirects the user to the dashboard.


2. Dashboard:
    - The user connects their social media accounts (YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok).
    - The user uploads their video and optionally provides a prompt.


3. Video Transcription:
    - The uploaded video is sent to the server.
    - The server invokes the Descript API to transcribe the video.
    - The transcription result is stored in the PostgreSQL database.


4. GPT-4 Caption Generation:
    - The transcription and user prompt (if provided) are sent to GPT-4.
    - GPT-4 generates a draft description and hashtags.


5. LangChain Processing:
    - The draft description and hashtags are sent to LangChain.
    - LangChain communicates with the four GPT-4 agents, each representing a social media platform.
    - Each agent reviews the draft content and provides feedback based on platform-specific requirements.
    - LangChain compiles the feedback and sends it back to GPT-4.
    - If modifications are needed, GPT-4 adjusts the content and sends the new draft to LangChain, and the process repeats until all requirements are met.


6. Content Finalization:
    - Once all platform requirements are met, the final content (description, hashtags) is stored in the PostgreSQL database.


7. Scheduling:
    - If the user chooses to schedule the post, the schedule_agent determines the best time for posting based on real-time platform usage and engagement.
    - The user can confirm the suggested time or choose a custom time.


8. Posting:
    - At the scheduled time, each posting agent fetches the final content from the PostgreSQL database.
    - The posting agent posts the video along with the platform-specific description and hashtags on the respective platform.

This flow should cover all the steps involved in the process, from user authentication to video posting. If I missed any specific detail you want to highlight, please let me know.

A project's working tree or workflow is essentially the order in which tasks need to be completed, often visualized as a tree or flow diagram. In your case, here's a simplified working tree:

1. **Project Setup**
   - Set up project repository
   - Create Flask application
   - Set up PostgreSQL database
   - Create basic React application

2. **User Authentication**
   - Implement user authentication
   - Design and implement user dashboard
   - Enable feature to connect social media accounts

3. **Video Upload and Transcription**
   - Implement video upload
   - Transcribe uploaded videos
   - Implement user prompt input feature

4. **Caption Generation**
   - Set up communication with GPT-4
   - Generate initial captions
   - Store generated captions and transcription

5. **LangChain Integration and Content Refinement**
   - Integrate LangChain
   - Implement feedback loop between LangChain, GPT-4, and agents
   - Store final content

6. **Content Review and Editing**
   - Implement functionality for users to review and edit final content

7. **Posting and Scheduling**
   - Implement posting agents
   - Implement scheduling feature
   - Set up schedule_agent
   - Implement functionality to determine optimal post times

8. **Testing**
   - Test all implemented features
   - Fix identified bugs

9. **Wrap-up and Next Steps**
   - Review project progress
   - Discuss outstanding tasks
   - Plan for next steps

While developing the working tree, it's important to remember that some tasks will be dependent on others, forming the branches of the tree. The tasks have been arranged in a way that ensures all dependencies are met before proceeding to the next stage. 

For example, "LangChain Integration and Content Refinement" depends on the completion of "Caption Generation". Similarly, "Posting and Scheduling" can only be implemented after "Content Review and Editing".

This working tree is fairly detailed and should cover all major aspects of your project. However, remember that a working tree should remain flexible and adaptive, as unforeseen challenges or changes in project scope might necessitate adjustments.
