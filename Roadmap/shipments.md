                                    EXTRA FEATURES


1. **Relevance of Data**: Real-time engagement data can provide invaluable insights into when a platform's users are most active, which can be used to ensure posts get the maximum visibility and engagement. This could significantly improve the effectiveness of the posts.


2. **Complexity**: Fetching real-time data and making forecasts based on that data can be complex and would likely require integrating with each platform's API and potentially using machine learning algorithms for the forecasting. However, if done successfully, this could be a powerful feature that sets your tool apart from others.


3. **Privacy Concerns**: It's important to consider privacy concerns and ensure that any data collection is done in accordance with the platforms' terms of service and privacy regulations.


4. **Accuracy**: Forecasting can be tricky and the accuracy will depend on the quality of the data and the effectiveness of the forecasting algorithm. It would be important to validate and test this feature thoroughly to ensure it provides accurate and useful results.


5. **User Control**: It could be beneficial to give users the ability to override the suggested post times if they have specific preferences or insider knowledge about their audience's behavior. 

Overall, it's an ambitious idea that could add significant value to your service, but it would require careful planning and execution to implement effectively.
